 * <p>XML serialization for all core classes is implemented in a separate layer. Each core class

 * com.akavrt.csp.core.xml.ProblemConverter. Converter classes implementing this interface are able
 * to process an instance of corresponding core class to org.jdom2.Element (export to XML) and vice
 * versa (import from XML).</p>
 *
 * <p>XML serialization was built using JDOM library, for more information check out this
